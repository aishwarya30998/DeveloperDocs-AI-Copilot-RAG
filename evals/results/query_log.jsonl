Enter into the `awesome-project` directory: `cd awesome-project`\n\nAdditionally, to create a virtual environment, you can use the `venv` module that comes with Python:\n\n1. Activate the virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv` (or `python -m uv .venv` if you have `uv` installed)\n\nNote that you only need to create a virtual environment once per project, and you can activate it to use it for all Python commands and package installations.", "source_count": 2, "confidence": "low", "chunks_retrieved": 3}
